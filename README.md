# 100daysofcode
## January 1, 2018
I have just started the 100daysofcode challenge. Even though not much coding was accomplished, it's a good start. I decided to restart my iOS project, "Swayter". I created the project on xcode and accomplished some of the object model for the application. I brushed up on iOS classes using part of lynda's Swift 4 essential training course. Hopefully I'll write some more code tomorrow.
